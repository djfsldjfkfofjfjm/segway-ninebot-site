																<h1>Anti-theft triggered by AHRS</h1>
																<p></p><p>Thanks to the AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System), your eScooter is anti-theft protected.<br>With an integrated 4G-enabled SIM and GPS, you can track the eScooter’s location at any time. The Segway E125S’s smart security system detects any irregular movement and sends notifications directly to your smartphone within seconds to give you peace of mind. If your eScooter is locked with a battery inside, any unusual actions such as pushing, moving, or accessing the vehicle will trigger the alarm system.</p><p></p>
