																<h1>Plug/unplug: it is that simple to charge your eScooter!</h1>
																<p></p><p>Our Segway eScooters are equipped with lithium batteries which are qualitative and environmentally friendly batteries.<br>In the Segway E125S, the two batteries are easy to remove from under the foot panel, plug in, and it only takes up to 4 hours if you charge them simultaneously. It is also possible to leave them in the eScooter and charge them directly from the vehicle (a socket is specially designed for this purpose on the eScooter).<br>Once the 4 green LED lights are turned on or you see on the mobile App that it is fully charged, your eScooter is ready and you can enjoy your journey with a range of up to 140km.</p><p></p>
